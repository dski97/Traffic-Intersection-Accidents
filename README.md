This was created using State data on intersection crash data and completing a buffer and near analsysis spatial join on intersection location. Crash accidents were geocoded to get lat/long information which was then concatened with Google Maps streetview to create a pin point map of the location.

Information pin points intersections with most accidents. This infomration could be used to study these areas and implement new safety infrastructure.
